This is a basic intro website to practice concepts of HTML5 that have been learnt from the Odin Project Foundations Course.

## First project outline
The exercise has focussed on using:
* implementing HTML boilerplate
* heading levels
* paragraphs
* lists (ordered and unorderd)
* links with href attribute
* image tags with associated src, alt height and width attributes.
  
A first attempt at using Git to add and commit changes was practiced while attempting to incorporate
best practices when adding commit messages (via VSCode) using a title and body (where needed).
